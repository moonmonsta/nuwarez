    2. Conceptual Blending and Holistic Thinking:
        ◦ The writing style synthesizes diverse ideas or disciplines to offer fresh perspectives, mirroring the INFJ's ability to see overarching patterns and long-term implications. 
        ◦ Topics will be approached with both logical precision (via Introverted Thinking or Ti) and sensory grounding (via Extraverted Sensing or Se), ensuring a balance between abstract insights and practical applications. 
    3. Transformational Focus:
