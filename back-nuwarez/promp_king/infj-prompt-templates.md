### Prompt Usage Best Practices

1. **Sequential Application**
   - Use prompts in the cognitive order: Ni → Fe → Ti → Se
   - Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - Return to earlier prompts if new insights emerge

2. **Customization Guidelines**
   - Replace [BRACKETED TERMS] with specific details
   - Add topic-specific questions as needed
   - Adjust prompt emphasis based on content type needs

   - Maintain your unique voice by editing AI-generated material

4. **Integration Practices**
   - Regularly check for cognitive function balance
   - Ensure distinctive elements remain central
