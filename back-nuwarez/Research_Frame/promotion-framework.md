# The Resonant Offering: Questions for Transformative Product and Brand Promotion

## Opening Reflection

Before crafting promotional content, take a moment to hold your offering in your awareness—not merely as a product or service but as a vessel of transformation. The most powerful promotion doesn't push people toward what you sell, but rather invites them into the space of possibility that you've created. When approached with genuine intention, promotion becomes an act of service—illuminating a path for those who are seeking exactly what you provide but may not yet have the language to name it.
